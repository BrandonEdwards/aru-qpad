	abstract = {Effective monitoring tools are key for tracking biodiversity loss and informing management intervention stra­ tegies. Passive acoustic monitoring promises to provide a cheap and effective way to monitor biodiversity across large spatial and temporal scales, however, extracting useful information from long-duration audio recordings still proves challenging. Recently, a range of acoustic indices have been developed, which capture different aspects of the soundscape, and may provide a way to estimate traditional biodiversity measures. Here we investigated the relationship between 13 acoustic indices obtained from passive acoustic monitoring and biodiversity estimates of various vertebrate taxonomic groupings obtained from manual surveys at six sites spanning over 20 degrees of latitude along the Australian east coast. We found a number of individual acoustic indices that correlated well with species richness, Shannon’s diversity index, and total individual count estimates obtained from traditional survey methods. Correlations were typically greater for avian and total vertebrate biodiversity than for anuran and non-avian vertebrate biodiversity. Acoustic indices also correlated better with species richness and total individual count than with Shannon’s diversity index. Random forest models incor­ porating multiple acoustic indices provided more accurate predictions than single indices alone. Out of the acoustic indices tested, cluster count, mid-frequency cover and spectral density contributed the greatest pre­ dictive ability to models. Our results suggest that models incorporating multiple acoustic indices could be a useful tool for monitoring certain vertebrate groups. Further work is required to understand how site-specific variables can be incorporated into models to improve predictive capabilities and how to improve the moni­ toring of taxa besides avians, particularly anurans.},

	abstract = {The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is one of the longest annual avian surveys and has the greatest spatiotemporally extensive coverage in the Western Hemisphere. Although this important survey provides trend estimates for more than 400 species, it has limited coverage in the boreal forest and biases in representation and detectability that complicate inference. Thus, there is a need to evaluate the potential of new technologies and analytical approaches to increase coverage and improve monitoring efficiency. We documented variation in counts between BBS surveys (hereafter “human BBS”) and different on-road and forest-edge surveys using autonomous recording units (ARUs) from 3 routes in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Specifically, we quantified percent differences (i.e., bias in counts) in species richness, abundance indices of birds, and species-specific variation in counts between human BBS and ARU-based surveys conducted on-road and at the forest edge at different dates and times of day. We also generated on-road effective detection radius (EDR) estimates for 15 species and tested for species-specific differences in EDR to explain bias in counts between on-road and forest-edge ARU surveys. Overall, species richness and abundance indices in human BBS surveys were higher than forest-edge ARU surveys conducted simultaneously and when similar forest-edge ARU surveys were conducted at sunset and a week earlier in June. However, there was no difference when comparing values from human BBS with on-road ARU BBS and forest-edge ARU surveys conducted at sunrise. Extracting the maximum count per species from 4 types of 3-minute forest-edge surveys increased counts by 62\% and 64\% for species richness and abundance indices, respectively, relative to human BBS, but the importance of this bias differed considerably among the 10 most common species in the study area. Our results suggest that false-negative bias in species detection could be corrected with appropriate methods, and ARUs deployed at the forest edge near BBS stops could be used to increase data quality of on-road surveys. When combined with appropriate correction factors to adjust for surveys done at the forest edge, ARUs could also be used to increase the geographic coverage of boreal surveys by allowing inexperienced volunteers to collect BBS data along winter or secondary roads in remote locations.},

	abstract = {Cue counting is a method developed for estimating vocally active wildlife density by dividing the density of cues (number of cues per unit area surveyed per unit time) by the average cue rate (ACR) at which individuals vocalize. It has been used successfully to estimate whale density using passive acoustic monitoring, but its efficacy has had limited testing in birds. We tested whether cue counting can be used to infer bird abundance using autonomous recording units and estimated the minimum effort required to obtain a reliable cue rate at individual and population levels. We recorded Dupont's Lark (Chersophilus duponti) vocalizations at 31 sites where traditional field censuses were also performed. We estimated the ACR using three methodologies: directional recordings, recordings from an online database of bird sounds (xeno-canto), and behavioral field studies. The ACRs estimated using directional recordings and behavioral field studies were similar, and bird numbers were over and underestimated by 0.8 and 10\%, respectively (74–77\% of the sampling sites were well estimated). However, the ACR estimated using xeno-canto recordings was much higher than those estimated using the other two methods, and bird numbers were underestimated by 41\%. We also performed a cost-effectiveness assessment of the number of individuals and recording durations needed to optimize the estimation of a reliable ACR. We found that ACR estimates were more efficient if long (25 min) recordings were used when {\textless} 4 males were recorded, whereas 5-min recordings were more efficient for ≥ 20 males. We conclude that cue counting can be useful to infer bird density around recorders but requires an accurate measure of the ACR. Further research should evaluate the effectiveness of passive cue counting on a large number of species and under different circumstances.},

	abstract = {Bioacoustic recordings are often used to conduct auditory surveys, in which human listeners identify vocalising animals on recordings. In these surveys, animals are typically counted regardless of their distance from the survey point. When these surveys are carried out in patchy habitat or near edges, detected individuals may frequently occur in a diﬀerent land-cover type than the survey point itself, which introduces uncertainty regarding species-habitat associations. We propose a method to restrict detections from single microphones to within a pre-speciﬁed survey radius. The method uses logistic regression to select a sound level threshold corresponding to the desired distance threshold. We applied this method to acoustic data from the centre of 21 1-ha oil wellsites in northern Alberta. To compare our approach with the results from auditory surveys from the same locations, we used sound localisation to locate birds detected via both methods. Just 22.4\% of birds detected on auditory surveys fell within the desired survey area. Using our distance-truncation method, 96\% of detections were within the desired survey area. We propose that distance truncation via sound level will be useful for surveys of patchily distributed habitat, or when greater certainty about bird locations or habitat associations is desired.},

	abstract = {Point counts are one of the most common ways of collecting data to determine the relative abundance of birds. Many studies and monitoring programs, including the North American Breeding Bird Survey, use relative differences in counts of birds to assess changes in abundance over time and space. Many factors influence whether relative differences in counts of birds between various environmental conditions are reflective of actual differences in bird density. A major assumption of relative abundance is that birds with different song frequencies and amplitudes are heard at the same distances in different environmental conditions. We compared sound transmission in forest habitats and along low-use forestry roads, and calculated detection radius for different species to test the assumption that differences in bird counts between forest interior and roadside locations reflect actual differences in bird abundance. A playback–recording experiment was used to broadcast sounds through forest interior, along a forest edge, and down forestry roads in conifer and deciduous forests to determine whether sound propagation differed across environments. Sound attenuated significantly faster in forests than along roads or forest edges. Similarly, the distance at which bird songs could be detected was significantly shorter in forest than along the road or forest edge for 20 of 25 species. We found the area surveyed to be up to twice as large on road compared to within forests, which suggests that roadside surveys might inflate avian density estimates in comparison to off-road counts. Local atmospheric conditions also influenced detection probability, but the magnitude of the effect was weaker than the land-cover effect. Major differences in detection between roads and interior forest suggest that comparisons of surveys conducted along roadsides and in forest areas should be done carefully if the goal is to make direct comparisons of abundance.},

	abstract = {Distance sampling is widely used to estimate animal population densities by accounting for imperfect detection of individuals with increasing distance from an observer. Distance sampling assumes that distances are measured without error; however, it is often applied to human estimated distances, which are known to be inconsistent, inaccurate, and biased. We present an objective technique for estimating distance to vocalizing individuals that relies on the relative sound level (RSL) of the vocalization extracted from autonomous recording unit (ARU) recordings and show the error is less than human estimated error extracted from a literature case study. RSL predicted distances can be obtained by manual measurement in sound viewing software, or automatically with automated signal recognition software. We built calibration datasets of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Common Nighthawks (Chordeiles minor) recorded at known distances and used regression of RSL from those recordings to predict distance. There was no error bias of RSL predicted distances when compared to known distances for Common Nighthawk, minimal error bias for Ovenbird, and error from all RSL predicted distances was less than human estimated error extracted from the literature. We then simulated ARU point count surveys with a known density and estimated that density with distance sampling to test whether RSL distance prediction does not violate the assumption that distances are measured without error. There was no difference in density estimates from known distance and density estimates obtained from RSL predicted distance, while density estimates contaminated with human estimated error were signiﬁcantly lower than density estimates from known distance. We found that a calibration dataset of approximately 300 vocalizations was suitable to minimize error for both species, and so conclude that RSL distance prediction is an accessible method of improving distance estimates relative to human estimation. We provide general recommendations on how to collect calibration recordings for the application of RSL distance prediction to other species and areas.},

What has not been done is an evaluation of how to standardize these two types of data so that they can be compared in the same analysis, especially when there are differences in the area sampled. We compared detection distances between human observers in the field and four commercially available recording devices (Wildlife Acoustics SM2, SM3, RiverForks, and Zoom H1) by simulating vocalizations of various avian species at different distances and amplitudes. We also investigated the relationship between sound amplitude and detection to simplify ARU calibration. We used these data to calculate correction factors that can be used to standardize detection distances of ARUs relative to each other and human observers. In general, humans in the field could detect sounds at greater distances than an ARU although detectability varied depending on species song characteristics. We provide correction factors for four commonly used ARUs and propose methods for calibrating ARUs relative to each other and human observers.},

	abstract = {Estimating the population abundance of landbirds is a challenging task complicated by the amount, type, and quality of available data. Avian conservationists have relied on population estimates from Partners in Flight (PIF), which primarily uses roadside data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). However, the BBS was not designed to estimate population sizes. Therefore, we set out to compare the PIF approach with spatially explicit models incorporating roadside and off-road point-count surveys. We calculated population estimates for 81 landbird species in Bird Conservation Region 6 in Alberta, Canada, using land cover and climate as predictors. We also developed a framework to evaluate how the differences between the detection distance, time-of-day, roadside count, and habitat representation adjustments explain discrepancies between the 2 estimators. We showed that the key assumptions of the PIF population estimator were commonly violated in this region, and that the 2 approaches provided different population estimates for most species. The average differences between estimators were explained by differences in the detection-distance and timeof-day components, but these adjustments left much unexplained variation among species. Differences in the roadside count and habitat representation components explained most of the among-species variation. The variation caused by these factors was large enough to change the population ranking of the species. The roadside count bias needs serious attention when roadside surveys are used to extrapolate over off-road areas. Habitat representation bias is likely prevalent in regions sparsely and non-representatively sampled by roadside surveys, such as the boreal region of North America, and thus population estimates for these regions need to be treated with caution for certain species. Additional sampling and integrated modeling of available data sources can contribute towards more accurate population estimates for conservation in remote areas of North America.},

They combined information about a bird species availability (i.e., whether it gives a cue that it is there) and perceptibility (i.e., whether an observer observes a cue), and use that information as an offset. These offsets can be used within a single data set to correct for detectability biases and transform data into estimates of true abundance or true density. Alternatively, these offsets SHOULD be able to be used to integrate data within a single modelling framework, as you can get all data speaking the same language of true abundnace (rather than abundance GIVEN survey type).},
	annote = {This is the first of a series of paper that uses the QPAD detectability offset. QPAD combines estimate of a birds' singing rate \${\textbackslash}phi\$ which is estimated using removal modelling, a birds' effective detection radius \${\textbackslash}tau\$ which is estimated using distance sampling, and infomration about the survey area. Here, they chose to model \${\textbackslash}phi\$ by a number of combinations of Julian Day and Time-since-Local-sunrise, and they chose to model \${\textbackslash}tau\$ by proportion of tree cover and land cover class. This reformatulion of removal and distance modelling allows for the estimation of avian density across point-count surveys that vary in survey duration, survey radius, and any intervals of those. One of the novel components of this paper is the fact that they were able to estimate availability *p* and perceptability *q* independently, therefore allowing the use of covariates to predict them. This offset approach has several potential benefits to be used, namely 1) it can be used to generate estimates of density for bird species, rather than abundance, and 2) it can be used to allow different data sets to speak the same "language" as the different data sets, once offset by QPAD, will both be giving density, accounting for differences in survey type. The authors warn of some potential biased estimation using QPAD for species that move at high rates (see Scott \& Ramsey 1981; Burnham et al 2004:352-356), move in response to observers (see Buckland et al 2001), or sing in irregular bouts or at low rates (see Alldredge et al 2007b).},

	abstract = {Animal vocalisations and natural soundscapes are fascinating objects of study, and contain valuable evidence about animal behaviours, populations and ecosystems. They are studied in bioacoustics and ecoacoustics, with signal processing and analysis an important component. Computational bioacoustics has accelerated in recent decades due to the growth of affordable digital sound recording devices, and to huge progress in informatics such as big data, signal processing and machine learning. Methods are inherited from the wider ﬁeld of deep learning, including speech and image processing. However, the tasks, demands and data characteristics are often different from those addressed in speech or music analysis. There remain unsolved problems, and tasks for which evidence is surely present in many acoustic signals, but not yet realised. In this paper I perform a review of the state of the art in deep learning for computational bioacoustics, aiming to clarify key concepts and identify and analyse knowledge gaps. Based on this, I offer a subjective but principled roadmap for computational bioacoustics with deep learning: topics that the community should aim to address, in order to make the most of future developments in AI and informatics, and to use audio data in answering zoological and ecological questions.},

	abstract = {Background: Both environmental variables and phylogenetic affinities can affect vocalizations. Unlearned vocalizations are characteristics of most non-oscine bird families, which have a relatively less-complex syrinx and vocalizations. Organism: A monophyletic group of underground-nesting seabirds (auklets: Aethiini, Alcidae, Charadriiformes) from the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, USA.
Methods: We mapped vocal characters (28 acoustic and 10 syringeal) from total repertoires of all members of the tribe Aethiini onto a molecular phylogeny to compare the relative influence of phylogeny and breeding habitat on vocal divergence.
Conclusion: Phylogeny, visual display, and ecological factors have contributed to vocal divergence in this clade. Temporal attributes and syringeal attributes of the acoustics of vocalization showed high congruence with phylogeny. Frequency attributes, which are affected by environmental variables, showed low congruence, and therefore high homoplasy.},

	abstract = {The elaborate songs of songbirds are frequent models for investigating the evolution of animal signals. However, few previous studies have attempted to reconstruct historical changes in song evolution using a phylogenetic comparative approach. In particular, no comparative studies of bird song have used a large number of vocal characters and a well-supported, independently derived phylogeny. We identiﬁed 32 features in the complex vocal displays of male oropendolas (genera Psarocolius, Gymnostinops, and Ocyalus) that are relatively invariant within taxa and mapped these characters onto a robust molecular phylogeny of the group. Our analysis revealed that many aspects of oropendola song are surprisingly evolutionarily conservative and thus are potentially useful characters for reconstructing historical patterns. Of the characters that varied among taxa, nearly two thirds (19 of 29) showed no evidence of evolutionary convergence or reversal when mapped onto the tree, which was reﬂected in a high overall consistency index (CI ϭ 0.78) and retention index (RI ϭ 0.88). Some reconstructed patterns provided evidence of selection on these signals. For example, rapid divergence of the songs of the Montezuma oropendola, Gymnostinops montezuma, from those of closely related taxa suggests the recent inﬂuence of strong sexual selection. In general, our results provide insights into the mode of vocal evolution in songbirds and suggest that complex vocalizations can provide information about phylogeny. Based on this evidence, we use song characters to estimate the phylogenetic afﬁnities of three oropendola taxa for which molecular data are not yet available.},

Traditional methods are limited by cost, accuracy and human resources. In this study, we investigated avian microhabitat preferences using microphone arrays that are capable of accurately locating vocalizing birds. Our objective was to identify the microhabitat associations of two common species in steep population decline, the Boreal Chickadee Poecile hudsonicus and the Cape May Warbler Setophaga tigrina. We deployed 68 eight-channel arrays at random locations in Labrador, Canada, during the 2016 avian breeding season. We returned in 2017 to the 18 array locations where the target species had been detected the previous year and characterized the microhabitat at the exact locations where they had been detected. We also characterized the microhabitat at randomly determined control locations. Results show that Boreal Chickadees select trees with greater diameter-at-breastheight that are surrounded by greater stem density. We did not ﬁnd evidence that Cape May Warblers exhibit microhabitat selection during song production. The study shows that microphone arrays are an effective tool for identifying preferred microhabitat that could be incorporated into future conservation or recovery strategies.},

	abstract = {Wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) are formed by a distributed group of acoustic-sensing devices featuring audio playing and recording capabilities. Current mobile computing platforms offer great possibilities for the design of audio-related applications involving acoustic-sensing nodes. In this context, acoustic source localization is one of the application domains that have attracted the most attention of the research community along the last decades. In general terms, the localization of acoustic sources can be achieved by studying energy and temporal and/or directional features from the incoming sound at different microphones and using a suitable model that relates those features with the spatial location of the source (or sources) of interest. This paper reviews common approaches for source localization in WASNs that are focused on different types of acoustic features, namely, the energy of the incoming signals, their time of arrival (TOA) or time difference of arrival (TDOA), the direction of arrival (DOA), and the steered response power (SRP) resulting from combining multiple microphone signals. Additionally, we discuss methods not only aimed at localizing acoustic sources but also designed to locate the nodes themselves in the network. Finally, we discuss current challenges and frontiers in this field.},

	abstract = {Occupancy modelling is an increasingly common framework for analysing acoustic data to study the variation in populations through space and time, but different survey designs endow survey locations with varying degrees of biological meaning. Recording units may be preferentially deployed in areas known to be important to a species, which implies an ‘area of occupancy’ conception of a species range, or recording units may be randomly deployed without knowledge of focal species space-use (e.g. a survey grid), which implies an ‘extent of occurrence’ conception of a species range. Preferential sampling requires substantial pre-survey information (e.g. the location of focal species territories) but leads to intuitive parameter interpretation and greater precision; vastly greater survey coverage is attainable with random sampling, but the resulting data merit careful postprocessing to achieve precise, ecologically meaningful results. Importantly, occupancy, detection, extinction and colonization estimates are incomparable between study designs. However, an understanding of focal species movement and vocal behaviour can inform the development of creative deﬁnitions of acoustic detections – and thus site occupancy – which may help bring the ecological realism of preferential sampling to the data yielded by the more scalable random sampling approach. Understanding the implications of study design choices on parameter interpretation is a fundamental aspect of basic ecological inference and endangered species monitoring.},

	abstract = {Wetland loss is cause for concern for populations of many wetland bird species throughout North America. The North American Breeding Bird Survey, the primary resource for broad-scale avian population data, does not provide sufficient data for many marsh bird species. Targeted marsh bird monitoring programs have been implemented across the continent in an attempt to fill this gap. Despite these efforts, a number of wetland species are so elusive that they remain an analytical challenge because of small sample sizes and low detectability. Thus, there is need for tools and approaches that will increase sampling efficiency and boost geographic representation. Autonomous recording units (ARUs) have the potential to address some of these challenges, but require the ability to combine in-person survey data with ARU data for collective analysis. Our primary objective was to estimate statistical offsets, or correction factors, to account for systematic differences between in-person and ARU counts of wetland-associated bird species. We found that ARU recordings were generally equivalent to in-person point counts, with bias in a small number of species (2 of 19 for Song MeterTM SM2 and 1 of 16 for Song MeterTM SM4 Acoustic Recorders; Wildlife Acoustics Inc. ©, Maynard, MA). However, bias was removed in all of the species through use of our correction factors. Therefore, our correction factors were effective for integrating in-person and ARU point count data even for species where differences exist. We also found that commercially available SM4 recorders have larger effective detection radii than SM2 recorders. Researchers should consider the microphone sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratios of any recording unit before purchasing, and more sensitive models with lower noise should be used where possible. Our results, and particularly our correction factors, are useful for biologists combining in-person and ARU point count data to achieve larger sample sizes, higher statistical power, and ultimately better information for more effective wetland conservation.},

We investigated whether arrival date estimated from ecozonal scale bioacoustic monitoring could be predicted by an independent estimate of estimated density for Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), Tennessee Warbler (Leiothlypis peregrina), and Yellow-rumped Warbler (Setophaga coronata). We also examined local Ovenbird settlement patterns by comparing relative arrival and observed local density differences between nearby territories. Arrival date was estimated as the first focal species detection date on a breeding territory and the cure4insect R package was used to predict estimated average density. Using predicted average density as a habitat quality proxy, we found earlier arrivals in higher quality territories (Ovenbird 1.04 +/- 0.33 days earlier, Tennessee Warbler 1.96 +/- 0.36 days earlier, Yellow-rumped Warbler 1.23 +/- 0.54 days earlier). We also showed that arrival time was earlier in habitats preferred by each species. Spatial patterns of arrival varied among species although latitude was always an important predictor. Locations where predicted Ovenbird densities were estimated to be higher were filled before sites with lower predicted density but only 600 m away (2.9 +/- 1.4 days earlier). Correlating migrant arrival time and density suggests density is a reasonable measure of habitat quality. Combined, density and arrival data from bioacoustics provide a low-cost habitat-assessment tool that better informs the types of forest that need to be protected for species of concern, which will be particularly important as land-use and climate change impacts increase in the boreal forest.},
